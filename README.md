![4 size view of the website's home page]()

<!-- Description -->
Take Stock is a data handling app for small buisnesses to take care of their stock and product information. A company can create a profile, add stock items, add products, and then link stock items to each product. The app will then tell the user exactly how many of each product they can make based on what they have in stock.
